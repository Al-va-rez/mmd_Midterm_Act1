                                Kazakhstan has a rich history shaped by nomadic cultures, empires, and modern developments.
                                For centuries, it was home to various nomadic tribes, including the Scythians and later the Turkic and Mongol peoples.
                                In the 13th century, it became part of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan.
                                By the 15th century, the Kazakh Khanate emerged, uniting nomadic groups and establishing a distinct Kazakh identity.                                
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-lg">
                                In the 18th and 19th centuries, Russia gradually took control of Kazakhstan,
                                leading to its incorporation into the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union.
                                Under Soviet rule, Kazakhstan experienced forced collectivization, devastating famines, and
                                became a site for nuclear testing and space exploration, including the Baikonur Cosmodrome.                                
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-lg">
                                Kazakhstan declared independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
                                Since then, it has developed into a major economic power in Central Asia,
                                rich in natural resources and known for its modern capital, Astana (formerly Nur-Sultan).
                                Today, it continues to balance its nomadic heritage with rapid modernization and global influence.
